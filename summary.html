            <p>
            Alot of mistakes are being made when websites are being developed all the time. 
            Some of them can be pretty hard to identify but some are very common and usually follow a certain line.
            As a web developer you have to be both qualified and creative to be able to create good sites.
            You need to consider many little details that seperate a good site from a bad one.
            Some of the most important things you need to bear in mind are website performance and looks.
            Those are the things that either keep the reader on the site or not.
            For example the author Abdullah tells us that according to studies about 5 seconds loading time is the
            time that makes a possible reader leave the site. He also says that reader very quickly makes up his mind
            about the site based on its looks.

            <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
            <p>
            This being the first course on web development for me, I don't really have a great knowledge
            about the details in web development world, so this article told me a great deal about it.
            for example keywords at your page are important for search engines such as google and yahoo to
            rank your page higher on their hierarchy and thus people to find your site. Also too many pictures and
            videos make your page slow but you can also boost your site using different tools.
            You also need to pay alot of attention to the visuality of your page. For example organizing the contents,
            headers, colors and contrast are very important. I found interesting that also web pages whose links are not
            working are being launched, so you have to also pay attention to that.

            <h3>Why is this article beneficial?</h3>
            <p>
            Keeping the points in mind from this article is very important to learn the right ways when learning web development.
            By knowing some of the key points that make your website bad, you make it possible to ignore the wrong patterns
            and thus not to learn the wrong ways. I found this article most interesting after checking the headers in plussa,
            so also being able to name your text interestingly probably makes it a good read, since it's one aspect you need to
